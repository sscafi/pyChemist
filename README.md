# Chemical Reaction Simulator.

=============================

## Overview

The Chemical Reaction Simulator is a Python script that simulates real-world chemical reactions for educational purposes. The script provides a simple and interactive interface for users to select a reaction to simulate and view the reactants and products.

## Features

### Reaction Simulation

- Simulates a variety of chemical reactions, including combustion, photosynthesis, acid-base neutralization, and oxidation-reduction
- Randomly selects a reactant and product for each reaction

### Interactive Interface

- Provides a menu-driven interface for users to select a reaction to simulate
- Lists all available reactions

### Educational Purposes

- Intended for educational purposes only
- Does not take into account actual chemical equations or reaction rates

## Usage

### Requirements

- Python 3.x

### Running the Script

- Save this script to a file (e.g. `chemical_reaction_simulator.py`)
- Run the script with `python chemical_reaction_simulator.py`

### Example Output
